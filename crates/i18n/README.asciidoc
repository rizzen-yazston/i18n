== Acknowledgement

Stefano Angeleri for advice on various design aspects of implementing the components of the internationalisation project, and also providing the Italian translation of error message strings.

== Usage

For most use cases, just the use of `i18n-rizzen-yazston` crate will be sufficient to use the multilingual message system, though the individual crates can be selected individual if the entire `i18n` project is not required.
