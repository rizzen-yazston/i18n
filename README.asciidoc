Welcome to the Internationalisation (`i18n`) project.

`i18n` provides alternative components for the {icu4x}[ICU4X] project (maintained by the {url-unicode}[*Unicode Consortium*]), yet still depends on many core components of `ICU4X` for internal functionality, thus can also be seen as an extension library to ICU4X. The `i18n` project consists of an alternative messaging system, and adding macro functionality to pattern.

The repository contains the following crates:

- `lstring`: Binding a `Locale` to a `String`,

- `lexer`: A simple lexer to tokenise a string,

- `pattern`: Similar to the `icu_pattern` crate of `ICU4X` with added macro functionality,

- `message`: The multilingual messaging system,

- `i18n`: The convenience meta crate that contains selected available crates,

- `utility`: Contains various useful components.

Note:: All these crates on `crates.io` have the names appended with the suffix `-rizzen-yazston` to distinguish them from other internationalisation creates by other authors.

== Usage

For most use cases, just the use of `i18n-rizzen-yazston` crate will be sufficient to use the multilingual message system, though the individual crates can be selected individual if the entire `i18n` project is not required.

=== Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
icu_locid = "1.0.0"
